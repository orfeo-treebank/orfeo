# orfeo

The orfeo search portal is a set of related tools for importing,
converting and exploring annotated corpora. It was created within the
project [ANR ORFEO](http://www.projet-orfeo.fr/).

This repository contains an installer that automates, to the extent
possible, installation of the complete set of tools on a system.

# How to install

You probably need to be running a Unix system (e.g. Linux). You
definitely need to have Ruby installed.

Get the file [installer.rb](installer.rb) and execute it. Read the
output carefully.
