# Project ORFEO

The project [ANR ORFEO](http://www.projet-orfeo.fr/) has multiple components. It involves the collection of linguistic data on both spoken and written modern French from a number of sources; harmonisation, alignment and additional annotation of the collected data; long-term storage of the data; and search and exploration. The repositories in this GitHub organisation cover the last point: a search and discovery tool for spoken and written corpora.

This repository contains documentation on the Orfeo platform on a general level, as well as an installer that automates, to the extent possible, installation of the complete set of tools on a system.

For details, see:

 * An overview of the [user interface](docs/interface.md).
 * [Installation instructions](docs/install.md) for the tools.
 * [Implementation notes](docs/implementation.md).
